# EtherToTheMoon

The project is live at https://ethereumtothemoon.github.io/ethertothemoon/

Hi guys, we just wanted to let you know that Ethereum is going to go to the moon. Like, all the way! So, you better buy Ethereum, like how we did in June '17 and HODL. 

No! No! Don’t think about BTC, free money and BS. You’re here for the right reasons, right? Ain’t just about money, right? 

Anyways, for the naysayers amongst you, I am going to say it again, “Ethereum will go to the moon because of Cool Decentralized Apps like this one. They can be built by anyone, served to everyone, forever!”. 

If that's not mind blowing for you, you need to wait for a while to understand its impact. 

See you around.
